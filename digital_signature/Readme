Digital signaturing the prescription to resist forgery and tampering. Here I have:

1. Created a script to digitally sign a prescription
2. Added a unsigned prescription
3. Added a signed prescription which was signed using the script
4. Addition required files (Digital ID and Signature PNG file)
5. Added a demo video here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bNCnyggYHfP-Pag4rveusMZvU0g9cNF9/view?usp=sharing
